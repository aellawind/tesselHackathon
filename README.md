tesselHackathon
===============

This is a project created by Amira Anuar and Chris Pak at a tessel.io hackathon where they used a single strand of LEDs connected to pin G4 on the GPIO bank and RGB leds with a 800kHZ signal to flash lights in response to music that is playing. Moving the accelerometer attached allows user to change up the lighting colors.
